In Humla, a remote district in Karnali Province where the nearest paved road is a multi-day walk, 75.8 percent of eligible voters showed up on election day in 2022. In Kathmandu-1, the capital's political heart, where polling stations are a short walk from cafés and coworking spaces, turnout hit 48.3 percent.

That's a 27.5-point gap. In the same country. On the same day.

Nepal's voter turnout story isn't really one story. It's two. In one version, democracy is alive and well — citizens in the country's most remote corners trudging hours to cast ballots, turnout rates that would make most Western democracies jealous. In the other, a growing chunk of the electorate — young, urban, educated — has decided that showing up isn't worth the bother. And that second story is winning.

Between 2017 and 2022, national turnout fell from 68.8 percent to 61 percent. That 7.8-point drop is the sharpest decline in Nepal's democratic history outside the civil war period. It represents roughly 1.4 million voters who would have shown up if participation had held steady but didn't. Where did they go? And should we be worried?

The short answer: yes. The long answer involves mountains, migration, generational cynicism, and a political class that may be losing its audience.

## Three decades of turnout tell a clear story — with one big twist

Let's start with the broad sweep. Nepal has held seven major national elections since its first free vote in 1991. Turnout has bounced around, but the pattern isn't random.

| Election | Year | Type | Turnout | Eligible Voters |
|----------|------|------|---------|-----------------|
| House 1 | 1991 | FPTP | 65.2% | 11,315,000 |
| House 2 | 1994 | FPTP | 62.8% | 12,000,000 |
| House 3 | 1999 | FPTP | 65.8% | 13,129,000 |
| CA 1 | 2008 | Mixed | 78.3% | 17,620,556 |
| CA 2 | 2013 | Mixed | 78.6% | 12,147,234 |
| House 5 | 2017 | Mixed | 68.8% | 15,371,000 |
| House 6 | 2022 | Mixed | 61.0% | 17,988,570 |

The 1990s elections hovered in the mid-60s — respectable for a brand-new democracy still figuring things out. Then came the Constituent Assembly elections of 2008 and 2013, and turnout spiked to nearly 78 percent. That makes sense. Those weren't ordinary elections. They were votes on what kind of country Nepal would become. The civil war had just ended. The monarchy had been abolished. People had real, tangible reasons to believe their vote would shape the future.

Here's the twist: once the constitution was written and ordinary parliamentary politics resumed, voters started leaving. The 2017 election — the first under the new federal system — pulled 68.8 percent. By 2022, it was 61 percent. Nepal went from one of South Asia's higher-turnout democracies to one that sits in the bottom quartile globally.

For context: India's 2019 election drew 67.4 percent. Sri Lanka's 2020 vote hit 75.9 percent. The OECD average is 68 percent. Nepal, at 61 percent, is closer to the United States (which has notoriously low turnout among rich democracies) than to its regional peers.

That's not a great club to be in.

## The geography of voting: mountains vote, cities don't

If you want to predict turnout in a Nepali constituency, you don't need a fancy model. Just ask one question: how far is it from a major city?

The 2022 provincial breakdown makes the pattern stark:

| Province | Turnout | vs. National Average |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Karnali | 67.3% | +6.3 |
| Sudurpashchim | 65.8% | +4.8 |
| Lumbini | 62.1% | +1.1 |
| Gandaki | 61.8% | +0.8 |
| **National** | **61.0%** | **—** |
| Bagmati | 58.2% | -2.8 |
| Province 1 | 57.9% | -3.1 |
| Madhesh | 56.4% | -4.6 |

Karnali and Sudurpashchim — the country's most remote, least urbanized provinces — lead the pack. Madhesh and Bagmati (home to the Kathmandu Valley) bring up the rear.

Break it down further by area type and the gradient gets even steeper:

| Area Type | Turnout | Examples |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Rural mountain | 68.2% | Humla, Mugu, Dolpa |
| Rural hill | 64.7% | Gorkha, Pyuthan, Rolpa |
| Rural plains | 58.1% | Rural Bara, Rautahat |
| Urban hill | 55.3% | Pokhara, Dharan |
| Urban valley | 52.8% | Kathmandu core |

A 15.4-point gap between rural mountain districts and urban Kathmandu. That's not a small difference. That's essentially two different electorates operating under the same system.

Look at the top 10 turnout constituencies and you'll see a pattern so consistent it's almost boring: Humla (75.8%), Mugu (74.2%), Bajura (72.9%), Darchula (71.6%), Jumla (71.3%). All remote. All mountainous. All in Karnali or Sudurpashchim. All places where election day is a genuine community event — the kind of thing you'd have to actively avoid to miss.

Now the bottom 10: Kathmandu-1 (48.3%), Kathmandu-3 (49.1%), Lalitpur-2 (49.7%), then a mix of Kathmandu constituencies and Madhesh districts like Rautahat-3 (51.2%) and Bara-2 (52.3%).

The reasons for this split aren't mysterious. In a village of 500 people, everyone knows whether you voted. There's social pressure, sure, but there's also social meaning — the election is an event, a gathering, a collective act. In Kathmandu, nobody knows and nobody cares. You're anonymous. You've got work. The polling station is inconvenient. And besides, your candidate will probably win or lose regardless.

But there's something else going on in the Madhesh numbers. Turnout there is low for different reasons than in Kathmandu. The gender gap in rural plains districts is 4.2 percentage points — more than double the national average. Cultural factors, including restrictions on women's mobility, play a role that doesn't show up in simple urban-rural comparisons.

## The age gap is real, and it's getting worse

If geography is the first big divider, age is the second. And it might matter more in the long run.

Exit poll estimates from 2022 paint a clear picture:

| Age Group | Turnout | Share of Electorate | Share of Actual Voters |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 18-25 | 52% | 23% | 19% |
| 26-35 | 58% | 28% | 26% |
| 36-45 | 64% | 22% | 23% |
| 46-60 | 68% | 18% | 20% |
| 60+ | 71% | 9% | 10% |

There's a 19-point gap between the youngest and oldest cohorts. Young voters aged 18-25 make up 23 percent of the electorate but only 19 percent of people who actually cast ballots. They're underrepresented. Seniors are overrepresented. And that means the policies that get prioritized skew toward what older voters want.

This pattern isn't unique to Nepal — every democracy on earth has a youth turnout gap. But the size matters. Nepal's 19-point gap is smaller than America's (25 points) but bigger than Germany's (12 points). And here's the part that should worry people: it's growing.

Youth turnout dropped from roughly 58 percent in 2017 to 52 percent in 2022. That 6-point decline is steeper than the overall 7.8-point national drop, which means young people are driving the trend. They're not just participating less than their grandparents — they're participating less than young people did five years ago.

Qualitative research with young voters keeps turning up the same themes. "All parties are the same." "Promises never kept." "My single vote doesn't matter." These aren't unreasonable conclusions. Nepal has had four different prime ministers since 2017. Coalition partners swap sides like they're changing seats at a dinner party. If you're 22 and you've watched this your entire adult life, why would you believe your vote changes anything?

## The gender gap is closing — but not everywhere

Here's some genuinely good news buried in the data. The gender gap in turnout has been shrinking steadily for three decades:

| Year | Male Turnout | Female Turnout | Gap |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----|
| 1991 | 67.8% | 62.4% | 5.4 |
| 1999 | 68.2% | 63.1% | 5.1 |
| 2008 | 79.4% | 77.1% | 2.3 |
| 2017 | 69.7% | 67.8% | 1.9 |
| 2022 | 62.1% | 59.8% | 2.3 |

In 1991, women voted at rates 5.4 points below men. By 2017, the gap was down to 1.9 points. It ticked back up slightly to 2.3 in 2022, but the long-term trajectory is clearly toward parity.

In the Kathmandu Valley, the gap is just 0.8 points — basically nothing. In rural hill districts, it's 1.5 points. But in rural plains areas, it's still 4.2 points. The national average masks real regional variation, and the places where the gap persists are the same places where women face the most constraints on mobility and independent decision-making.

So: progress, yes. But uneven progress. And the slight widening in 2022 is worth watching.

## The education paradox

Here's something that defies what most people would expect. At the constituency level, higher literacy rates correlate with *lower* turnout:

| Literacy Rate | Avg Constituency Turnout |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Below 50% | 66.4% |
| 50-70% | 62.1% |
| 70-85% | 59.3% |
| Above 85% | 54.7% |

Wait — more educated areas vote less? That seems backward.

But it's not really about education. It's about what education proxies for. High-literacy constituencies are overwhelmingly urban. Low-literacy constituencies are overwhelmingly rural. You're not measuring the effect of education on voting; you're measuring the effect of urbanization, with education along for the ride.

When researchers control for urban-rural status and look at individual-level data, the relationship gets weird. College-educated voters turn out at about 58 percent. High-school-only voters: 62 percent. Primary education or less: 59 percent. It's a slight U-shape — the middle-education group votes most. The effect is small enough that it might be noise.

The same confounding issue shows up with income. Wealthier constituencies have lower turnout, but that's because wealthier constituencies are urban. Strip out the geography and the income effect largely disappears.

The lesson: be careful about reading constituency-level patterns as individual behavior. The ecological fallacy is real, and it's everywhere in turnout data.

## So what happened between 2017 and 2022?

The 7.8-point decline deserves a proper autopsy. There are four plausible explanations, and the data lets us weigh them.

### Was it COVID?

The 2022 election was Nepal's first post-pandemic vote. Maybe people were still spooked, or maybe the pandemic disrupted the social networks that mobilize voters.

The evidence here is weak. By November 2022, the pandemic was largely over. Other countries held post-COVID elections without major turnout collapses. India's 2024 state elections saw normal participation. COVID might explain a point or two, but it can't carry the weight of a nearly 8-point drop.

### Was it disillusionment?

Pre-election polling in 2022 found that satisfaction with democracy had dropped from 58 percent to 42 percent since 2017. The share of people who believed "parties care about people like me" fell from 49 percent to 31 percent. The share who felt their vote made a difference: down from 68 percent to 54 percent.

Those are big swings. And they track closely with the turnout decline. This is probably the single biggest factor.

Think about what happened between those two elections. Nepal got its first parliament under the new federal system in 2017, and then... the government collapsed. And reformed. And collapsed again. KP Sharma Oli and Sher Bahadur Deuba traded the prime ministership. Coalition partners switched allegiances. The political class seemed more interested in power games than governance. If you were a voter watching this, what conclusion would you draw?

### Was it migration?

The 2021 census found 2.1 million people living outside their birth district. Many of them are still registered to vote back home. Voting requires traveling to your registered constituency — which, if you've moved to Kathmandu for work, might mean a day-long bus ride each way.

This is a real barrier, and it probably explains 2 to 3 percentage points of the decline. Urban constituencies (where migrants end up) have low turnout, but rural constituencies (where they're registered) haven't seen a compensating bump. Those votes are just... lost.

### Was it the kids?

Youth turnout dropped about 6 points. The overall drop was 7.8. Young voters didn't cause the entire decline, but they're a disproportionate part of it.

And Nepal's electorate is young. Voters aged 18-35 make up over half the eligible population. When that group checks out, it moves the national number.

### Putting it together

A constituency-level regression model helps sort out the relative contributions. The strongest predictors of turnout decline from 2017 to 2022 were:

- Urban status: -4.2 percentage points
- Youth population share: -2.8 points per 10% increase in youth share
- Rising poverty: -1.4 points per 5% poverty increase
- Remoteness: +1.8 points (remote areas declined *less*)

Translation: the decline was concentrated in urban areas with lots of young people experiencing economic stress. Rural, remote, older communities barely budged. The two electorates are diverging.

## How Nepal compares — and what other countries have tried

Nepal's 61 percent turnout puts it in a specific category: voluntary-voting developing democracies with middling participation. For comparison:

Countries with compulsory voting blow past these numbers. Australia hits 91 percent. Belgium: 87 percent. Brazil: 79 percent. No major Nepali party has proposed mandatory voting, and the cultural emphasis on rights over duties makes adoption unlikely. But it's worth noting that the gap between Nepal's turnout and Australia's isn't about civic virtue — it's about institutional design.

Nepal already does one thing right: election day is a public holiday. That removes the work-schedule barrier that suppresses turnout in countries like the United States, where voting happens on a regular Tuesday. But a holiday doesn't help if you're registered in a district 12 hours away by bus.

## What could actually fix this?

There are five evidence-based interventions that could plausibly push turnout back toward the high 60s or even the 70s.

**Automatic voter registration.** In 2022, Nepal had 17.9 million registered voters, but census data suggests 20 million or more were eligible. That's a gap of at least 2 million people who never made it onto the rolls. Automatically registering citizens when they turn 18 could add 3 to 5 points to turnout.

**Absentee or mobile voting for migrants.** This is the big one. With 2.1 million internal migrants unable to easily vote, some form of vote-by-mail or vote-anywhere system could recover 2 to 4 points. It's technically complicated but not impossible — India manages it for some categories of voters.

**Civic education in schools.** This is a long game. You won't see results for a decade. But mandatory civics curricula that emphasize participation (not just rote constitutional knowledge) could narrow the youth gap by 3 to 6 points over time.

**More polling stations.** The average rural voter travels 4.8 kilometers to their polling station. Nepal currently has 10,892 stations for 165 constituencies. Adding more, especially in areas with difficult terrain, could add 1 to 2 points.

**Simpler ballot design.** Nepal's mixed system requires voters to fill out two ballots — one for FPTP, one for PR. Confusion about the process, especially among less literate voters, suppresses participation at the margins. Clearer instructions and visual aids could add half a point to a point. Small, but it helps the people who need it most.

If all five were implemented? Turnout could plausibly reach 71 to 78 percent. That's a big if — these reforms require political will, and the parties currently in power got there with 61 percent turnout. They may not be eager to change the electorate that elected them.

## Should we actually worry about low turnout?

This is a question that sounds simple but isn't. Low turnout can mean different things.

If people aren't voting because they're satisfied — life is good, the system works, no urgent need to weigh in — then low turnout is a sign of stability, not crisis. Political scientists call this the "politics of happiness" theory.

If people aren't voting because they're afraid, or because the system actively prevents them from participating, that's a democratic emergency.

Nepal's situation is neither of those extremes. The polling data points to alienation and cynicism, not satisfaction and not fear. People *can* vote. They just don't think it matters. That's a warning sign — not a five-alarm fire, but the kind of slow leak that gets worse if you ignore it.

And there's a representational problem baked in. When young, urban voters check out and older, rural voters stay engaged, the resulting parliament reflects one Nepal more than the other. Look at the 2022 results: an increasingly fragmented parliament (the effective number of parties hit 4.75, the highest ever measured) elected by the oldest, most rural slice of the population. The people most affected by economic policy, urbanization, and the job market are the least represented in the body that makes those decisions.

That's not a recipe for a political system that feels legitimate to its citizens.

## What we know and what we don't

Here's what the data tells us with reasonable confidence:

Nepal's turnout decline is real, concentrated among young and urban voters, and driven primarily by political disillusionment rather than structural barriers (though migration-related barriers matter too). The geographic divide in participation is enormous and growing. The gender gap, by contrast, is shrinking — a genuine success story. And there are concrete, evidence-based reforms that could reverse the trend if anyone decides to implement them.

Here's what we don't know: whether the decline will continue. The 2022 election might represent a floor — the point at which disengaged voters have already left and the remaining electorate is stable. Or it might be a waypoint on the way to something worse. We also don't know how the RSP's emergence in 2022 (winning 20 seats from zero) affected the calculation. New parties can either mobilize new voters or split existing ones, and we don't have enough data yet to tell which happened here.

The biggest unknown is whether Nepal's political class will take the hint. When 39 percent of your citizens don't bother to vote, they're telling you something. The question is whether anyone in power is listening — or whether they're too busy forming the next coalition to notice.
