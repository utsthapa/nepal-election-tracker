# The Sainte-Laguë Method: How Nepal Allocates Proportional Representation Seats

Nepal uses a mixed electoral system: 165 seats via First-Past-The-Post (FPTP), and 110 seats via Proportional Representation (PR). But how exactly are those 110 PR seats divided among parties?

The answer: The **Sainte-Laguë method**, a mathematical formula that converts vote percentages into seat allocations.

This article explains the math, shows worked examples, and explores why this method was chosen over alternatives.

## The Problem: Vote Shares Don't Equal Seat Shares

**Scenario**: Five parties compete for 110 PR seats. Vote shares:
- Party A: 35.2%
- Party B: 28.7%
- Party C: 18.3%
- Party D: 12.4%
- Party E: 5.4%

**Question**: How many seats does each party get?

**Naive approach**: Multiply vote share by 110 seats:
- Party A: 35.2% × 110 = 38.72 seats (?!)
- Party B: 28.7% × 110 = 31.57 seats
- Party C: 18.3% × 110 = 20.13 seats
- Party D: 12.4% × 110 = 13.64 seats
- Party E: 5.4% × 110 = 5.94 seats

**Problem**: You can't have 0.72 of a seat! We need an allocation method that:
1. Gives whole numbers
2. Adds up to exactly 110
3. Fairly represents vote shares
4. Treats parties equally

## Enter Sainte-Laguë: The Solution

The Sainte-Laguë method (also called Webster method) solves this by allocating seats one at a time using a **priority quotient**.

**Formula**:
```
Quotient = Votes / (2s + 1)
```

Where:
- `Votes` = number of votes the party received
- `s` = seats already allocated to that party

**Process**:
1. Calculate quotient for each party (starting with s=0)
2. Give one seat to party with highest quotient
3. Recalculate quotient for that party (now s=1)
4. Repeat until all 110 seats allocated

## Worked Example: Step-by-Step

Let's allocate 10 seats among 3 parties:

**Votes**:
- Party A: 10,000 votes (50%)
- Party B: 6,000 votes (30%)
- Party C: 4,000 votes (20%)
- **Total**: 20,000 votes

### Round 1: All parties start with 0 seats (s=0)

| Party | Votes | s | Divisor (2s+1) | Quotient |
|-------|-------|---|----------------|----------|
| A     | 10,000| 0 | 1              | 10,000   |
| B     | 6,000 | 0 | 1              | 6,000    |
| C     | 4,000 | 0 | 1              | 4,000    |

**Winner**: Party A (highest quotient: 10,000)
**Seat 1 → Party A**

### Round 2: Party A now has 1 seat (s=1)

| Party | Votes | s | Divisor (2s+1) | Quotient |
|-------|-------|---|----------------|----------|
| A     | 10,000| 1 | 3              | 3,333    |
| B     | 6,000 | 0 | 1              | 6,000    |
| C     | 4,000 | 0 | 1              | 4,000    |

**Winner**: Party B (highest quotient: 6,000)
**Seat 2 → Party B**

### Round 3: A has 1, B has 1

| Party | Votes | s | Divisor (2s+1) | Quotient |
|-------|-------|---|----------------|----------|
| A     | 10,000| 1 | 3              | 3,333    |
| B     | 6,000 | 1 | 3              | 2,000    |
| C     | 4,000 | 0 | 1              | 4,000    |

**Winner**: Party C (highest quotient: 4,000)
**Seat 3 → Party C**

### Round 4: A has 1, B has 1, C has 1

| Party | Votes | s | Divisor (2s+1) | Quotient |
|-------|-------|---|----------------|----------|
| A     | 10,000| 1 | 3              | 3,333    |
| B     | 6,000 | 1 | 3              | 2,000    |
| C     | 4,000 | 1 | 3              | 1,333    |

**Winner**: Party A (highest quotient: 3,333)
**Seat 4 → Party A**

### Continuing the process...

**Seats 5-10**:
- Seat 5 → A (quotient: 2,000)
- Seat 6 → B (quotient: 2,000)  *tie with A, resolved by lot*
- Seat 7 → C (quotient: 1,333)
- Seat 8 → A (quotient: 1,429)
- Seat 9 → B (quotient: 1,200)
- Seat 10 → A (quotient: 1,111)

**Final allocation**:
- Party A: **5 seats** (50% votes → 50% seats) ✓
- Party B: **3 seats** (30% votes → 30% seats) ✓
- Party C: **2 seats** (20% votes → 20% seats) ✓

Perfect proportionality!

## Why 2s + 1? The Math Behind the Formula

The divisor sequence (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...) represents odd numbers.

**Intuition**: Each party's quotient decreases as they gain seats, making it harder to win additional seats. This prevents large parties from hoarding seats early.

**Comparison to alternatives**:

**D'Hondt method** (used in many European countries):
- Divisor: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
- Favors larger parties slightly

**Sainte-Laguë**:
- Divisor: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...
- Neutral to party size

**Modified Sainte-Laguë** (used in Norway, Sweden):
- Divisor: 1.4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...
- Slightly disfavors very small parties (raises first divisor)

Nepal uses **standard Sainte-Laguë** (1, 3, 5, 7...), which is considered the most proportional method.

## The 3% Electoral Threshold

Before seats are allocated, parties must cross the **3% national vote threshold**.

**Example with threshold**:

**Votes** (1 million total):
- Party A: 350,000 (35%)
- Party B: 280,000 (28%)
- Party C: 180,000 (18%)
- Party D: 120,000 (12%)
- Party E: 40,000 (4%)
- Party F: 30,000 (3%)  ← Below threshold!

**Result**: Party F's 30,000 votes are excluded. The 110 seats are divided only among parties that crossed 3%.

**Recalculated base** (970,000 votes):
- Party A: 350,000 / 970,000 = 36.08%
- Party B: 280,000 / 970,000 = 28.87%
- Party C: 180,000 / 970,000 = 18.56%
- Party D: 120,000 / 970,000 = 12.37%
- Party E: 40,000 / 970,000 = 4.12%

Seats are allocated based on these adjusted percentages.

**Implication**: Votes for sub-threshold parties are "wasted." This incentivizes strategic voting and coalition formation.

## Real-World Example: Nepal 2022 PR Allocation

**National PR votes** (2022 election):

| Party | Votes | % | Above 3%? |
|-------|-------|---|-----------|
| NC    | 2,518,582 | 26.59% | ✓ |
| UML   | 2,519,976 | 26.61% | ✓ |
| Maoist| 1,214,247 | 12.82% | ✓ |
| RSP   | 1,235,586 | 13.05% | ✓ |
| RPP   | 648,354   | 6.85%  | ✓ |
| JSPN  | 636,212   | 6.72%  | ✓ |
| JP    | 412,500   | 4.36%  | ✓ |
| Others| 283,450   | 2.99%  | ✗ |

**Total qualifying votes**: 9,185,457 (97.01%)

**Sainte-Laguë allocation** (110 seats):

| Party | Votes | Seats | Seat % | Vote % | Diff |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|------|
| NC    | 2,518,582 | 32 | 29.09% | 26.59% | +2.50% |
| UML   | 2,519,976 | 34 | 30.91% | 26.61% | +4.30% |
| Maoist| 1,214,247 | 14 | 12.73% | 12.82% | -0.09% |
| RSP   | 1,235,586 | 13 | 11.82% | 13.05% | -1.23% |
| RPP   | 648,354   | 7  | 6.36%  | 6.85%  | -0.49% |
| JSPN  | 636,212   | 6  | 5.45%  | 6.72%  | -1.27% |
| JP    | 412,500   | 4  | 3.64%  | 4.36%  | -0.72% |

**Average deviation**: 1.51% (very proportional!)

**Observations**:
- UML slightly overrepresented (+4.3%)
- RSP slightly underrepresented (-1.2%)
- Overall very close to vote shares

This is the hallmark of Sainte-Laguë: **maximum proportionality**.

## Sainte-Laguë vs D'Hondt: A Comparison

If Nepal used **D'Hondt** instead, with the same 2022 votes:

| Party | Sainte-Laguë | D'Hondt | Difference |
|-------|--------------|---------|------------|
| NC    | 32           | 33      | +1         |
| UML   | 34           | 34      | 0          |
| Maoist| 14           | 14      | 0          |
| RSP   | 13           | 13      | 0          |
| RPP   | 7            | 7       | 0          |
| JSPN  | 6            | 6       | 0          |
| JP    | 4            | 3       | -1         |

**Result**: D'Hondt gives 1 more seat to NC (largest party), 1 fewer to JP (smallest qualifying party).

**Why D'Hondt favors larger parties**:
- Lower initial divisor (1 vs 1)
- Smaller gaps between divisors (1,2,3 vs 1,3,5)
- Larger parties maintain higher quotients longer

**Why Nepal chose Sainte-Laguë**:
- More proportional
- Better represents smaller parties
- Reduces wasted votes
- Internationally recognized as fairest method

## Edge Cases and Tie-Breaking

### What if two parties have identical quotients?

**Example**: Party A and Party B both have quotient of 2,500 for the final seat.

**Nepal's rule**: Determined by lot (random draw).

**Practical occurrence**: Rare. In 2022, no ties occurred.

### What if rounding creates 109 or 111 seats?

**Can't happen mathematically**. Sainte-Laguë always allocates exactly the specified number of seats because it's an iterative process (allocate one seat at a time, stop at 110).

**Contrast with largest remainder methods**, which can require correction adjustments.

### What about female quota requirements?

The PR list must include **at least 1 woman in every 2 candidates**.

**Process**:
1. Sainte-Laguë determines total seats per party
2. Within each party's allocation, seats go to candidates in list order
3. If a party fails to meet gender quota, their list is invalidated (hasn't happened due to pre-election enforcement)

**Example**: UML wins 34 PR seats
- List: Candidate 1 (M), 2 (F), 3 (M), 4 (F), 5 (M), 6 (F)...
- Seats go to candidates 1-34 in order
- Quota check: At least 17 must be women ✓

## Why Proportional Representation Matters

**Without PR** (pure FPTP):
- 2022 FPTP results: NC 57, UML 44, Maoist 18
- UML got 26.6% of national votes but only 26.7% of FPTP seats

**With PR** (110 seats):
- Corrects disproportionality
- UML gets 34 additional PR seats → total 78 (28.4% of 275)

**Combined system benefits**:
- FPTP provides local representation
- PR provides proportionality
- Smaller parties get parliamentary voice
- Reduces winner-take-all extremism

## Interactive Example: Try It Yourself

**Scenario**: 10 seats to allocate

| Party | Votes |
|-------|-------|
| Red   | 4,200 |
| Blue  | 3,100 |
| Green | 2,700 |

**Step 1**: Calculate first round quotients (all have s=0, divisor=1)
- Red: 4,200 / 1 = 4,200 ✓ **Seat 1**
- Blue: 3,100 / 1 = 3,100
- Green: 2,700 / 1 = 2,700

**Step 2**: Recalculate (Red now has s=1, divisor=3)
- Red: 4,200 / 3 = 1,400
- Blue: 3,100 / 1 = 3,100 ✓ **Seat 2**
- Green: 2,700 / 1 = 2,700

**Step 3**: Continue...

**Final result**:
- Red: 5 seats (42% votes → 50% seats)
- Blue: 3 seats (31% votes → 30% seats)
- Green: 2 seats (27% votes → 20% seats)

## Mathematical Properties

Sainte-Laguë satisfies several fairness criteria:

**1. Monotonicity**: If a party gains votes while others stay constant, it cannot lose seats.

**2. House monotonicity**: If total seats increase, no party loses seats.

**3. Population pair-wise consistency**: If two party vote shares are compared in isolation, their relative seat share should match their relative vote share.

**4. Balinsky-Young Theorem**: Sainte-Laguë minimizes the maximum deviation from exact proportionality.

**What it doesn't satisfy**:

**Alabama paradox** immunity: Increasing total seats could (theoretically) decrease a party's allocation. In practice, almost never happens with 100+ seats.

## Comparative International Use

**Countries using Sainte-Laguë**:
- New Zealand
- Germany (for overhang seats)
- Norway (modified)
- Sweden (modified)
- Bosnia & Herzegovina
- Nepal
- Iraq

**Countries using D'Hondt**:
- Spain
- Belgium
- Switzerland
- Portugal
- Most of Latin America

**Why the split?**
- Sainte-Laguë: Favored in multi-party systems valuing proportionality
- D'Hondt: Favored when some governability bonus for large parties is desired

**Nepal's choice**: Reflects commitment to inclusive democracy and multiparty representation.

## Common Misconceptions

**Myth 1**: "Sainte-Laguë is too complicated."

**Reality**: The math is simple (division). Computers calculate instantly. Voters don't need to understand the formula, only that seats match votes fairly.

**Myth 2**: "PR creates too many small parties."

**Reality**: The 3% threshold prevents extreme fragmentation. Nepal has 7-8 significant parties, similar to other democracies.

**Myth 3**: "FPTP is more representative because it's local."

**Reality**: FPTP creates disproportionality (party with 40% votes can win 60% of seats). PR + FPTP balances local representation with national proportionality.

**Myth 4**: "Largest remainder methods are simpler."

**Reality**: Sainte-Laguë is iterative (easier to compute) and avoids quota calculation complexity.

## Conclusion: Elegant Mathematics for Fair Representation

The Sainte-Laguë method achieves what seems impossible: converting continuous vote percentages into discrete seat counts while maintaining proportionality.

The formula `Votes / (2s + 1)` elegantly balances:
- Rewarding popular parties
- Representing smaller parties fairly
- Avoiding mathematical paradoxes
- Maintaining democratic legitimacy

Next time you see "NC: 32 PR seats, UML: 34 PR seats," you'll know those numbers weren't arbitrary—they're the output of a century-old mathematical formula designed to translate the will of the people into parliamentary representation with maximum fairness.
