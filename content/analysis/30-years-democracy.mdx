# Nepal's Democracy Isn't Failing. It's Just Awkward.

Thirty years ago, Nepal held its first free election after three decades of autocratic rule. Since then, the country has survived a civil war, a royal massacre, and the abolition of its monarchy. Through it all, one thing stayed constant: Nepalis kept voting.

What does three decades of electoral data actually reveal about how democracy has — and hasn't — taken root? I spent weeks digging through the numbers from all eight elections between 1991 and 2022, and the picture that comes back is more interesting than the usual "Nepal is unstable" narrative you hear. The data says something different. It says Nepal's democracy is maturing. It just looks really messy while it does it.

Here's the thesis: Nepal has gone from a rigid two-party system with manufactured majorities to a genuinely competitive multiparty democracy where coalitions are the norm, not the exception. That transition has been bumpy. Turnout is falling. Parties keep splintering. Governments keep reshuffling. But underneath all that noise, the fundamentals are solid. Elections happen on schedule. Power transfers peacefully. More voices get heard. And voters? They're smarter than they get credit for.

Let me walk you through the evidence.

## Three eras, one democracy

You can't understand Nepal's elections without understanding that they've happened in three very different political contexts. Think of them as chapters in the same book, but written in different genres.

**Chapter One: The FPTP years (1991–1999).** Nepal held three elections under a pure first-past-the-post system with 205 seats. Two parties dominated: Nepali Congress on the center-left and CPN-UML on the left. That's it. In 1991, NC grabbed 110 seats — a comfortable majority — on just 37.8% of the vote. Read that again. Barely more than a third of voters chose NC, and they got nearly 54% of the seats. FPTP does that. It manufactures majorities out of pluralities, and in 1990s Nepal, it locked out smaller parties almost entirely. Only seven parties won seats in 1999.

**Chapter Two: The post-conflict elections (2008–2013).** After a decade-long civil war, a royal massacre, a king's power grab, and a people's movement that restored democracy, Nepal held elections for a Constituent Assembly to write a new constitution. The electoral system changed to mixed-member proportional: 240 FPTP seats plus 335 PR seats plus 26 nominated members, for a total of 601. And the Maoists — the rebel group that had fought the government for ten years — entered the ballot box. They won. Big. 220 seats. The former guerrillas became the largest party through a democratic vote. That's a sentence worth sitting with.

**Chapter Three: Federal elections (2017–2022).** The 2015 constitution created a federal structure and trimmed parliament to 275 seats (165 FPTP, 110 PR). Two elections so far. The first, in 2017, saw a left alliance of UML and Maoists steamroll everyone. The second, in 2022, produced the most fragmented parliament in Nepal's history, with a brand-new party — RSP — winning 20 seats in its debut.

| Election | Year | System | Seats | Turnout |
|----------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| House 1 | 1991 | FPTP | 205 | 65.2% |
| House 2 | 1994 | FPTP | 205 | 62.8% |
| House 3 | 1999 | FPTP | 205 | 65.8% |
| CA 1 | 2008 | Mixed | 601 | 78.3% |
| CA 2 | 2013 | Mixed | 601 | 78.6% |
| House 5 | 2017 | Mixed | 275 | 68.8% |
| House 6 | 2022 | Mixed | 275 | 61.0% |

The highest turnout? 78.6% in 2013, when Nepalis were voting for the second time to elect an assembly to write their constitution. The lowest? 61% in 2022. That 17.6-point drop is the steepest decline in Nepal's democratic history. We'll get to why that matters.

## The party system blew up — and that's actually fine

If you only look at one number to understand how Nepal's politics have changed, make it the Effective Number of Parties, or ENP. It's a standard political science measure that accounts for both the number of parties and their relative size. An ENP of 2.0 means a pure two-party system. An ENP of 5.0 means a lot of competitive parties splitting the pie.

| Election | ENP (Seats) | ENP (Votes) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1991 | 2.3 | 3.1 |
| 1994 | 2.7 | 3.4 |
| 1999 | 2.4 | 3.2 |
| 2008 | 4.2 | 4.8 |
| 2013 | 3.8 | 4.3 |
| 2017 | 3.1 | 4.1 |
| 2022 | 4.8 | 5.2 |

Look at that jump. In the 1990s, Nepal hovered around 2.3–2.7 effective parties by seat share. A two-and-a-half party system. Then the mixed electoral system arrived, and the ENP nearly doubled. By 2022, it hit 4.8 — the highest ever. Eight parties held 10 or more seats. Twenty-five parties won seats in 2008, compared to seven in 1999.

Some people look at this and see chaos. I look at it and see representation. Under FPTP, a third of voters chose parties that won almost nothing. Under the mixed system, those voters actually get seats in parliament. That's not instability. That's democracy working as designed.

But — and this is a real "but" — fragmentation has a cost. Since 2008, not a single party has won a majority. Zero. In four consecutive elections. The largest party's seat share has dropped from 54% in 1999 to 32.4% in 2022. Coalition governments aren't a phase Nepal is going through. They're the permanent reality.

## The rise and fall (and rise and fall) of Nepal's parties

Here's where the data gets really interesting. Nepal's parties don't just compete — they swing wildly. The Pedersen Index measures vote volatility between elections: how much the overall vote share shifts from one election to the next. Established democracies typically see volatility of 8–12%. New democracies run 15–25%.

Nepal's average? About 17.5%. Right in the range you'd expect for a developing democracy. But the swings within that average are dramatic.

| Election Pair | Pedersen Index |
|---------------|---------------|
| 1991 → 1994 | 12.3 |
| 1994 → 1999 | 8.7 |
| 1999 → 2008 | 28.4 |
| 2008 → 2013 | 21.6 |
| 2013 → 2017 | 15.2 |
| 2017 → 2022 | 18.9 |

That 28.4 between 1999 and 2008 is enormous. It reflects the Maoist entry — an entirely new political force capturing 29.3% of the vote in its first election. The system didn't just shift. It realigned. And the 18.9 in 2022 is above average too, driven largely by RSP's sudden arrival and the fallout from the UML-Maoist split.

What does all this volatility actually mean for individual parties? Let me trace the trajectories.

### Nepali Congress: the party that won't die

NC is the cockroach of Nepali politics. I mean that as a compliment. Its vote share has bounced between 21% and 38% across eight elections, and it's been the largest party in four of them. In 2017, it hit rock bottom: 63 seats, just 22.9% of parliament. Its worst performance ever. But by 2022, it bounced back to 89 seats and 32.4%.

NC's secret isn't charisma or ideology. It's geography. The party has genuine cross-regional appeal — competitive in the Kathmandu Valley, the western hills, and parts of Madhesh. No other party can say that. UML is concentrated in the east. The Maoists cluster in former conflict zones. RSP is an urban phenomenon. NC is the only truly national party, and in a system that requires coalition-building across regions, that matters.

The weakness? NC is old. Not just in terms of leadership (though that too) — it's old in the eyes of young voters. Survey data suggests youth voters in urban areas preferred RSP over NC by an 18-point margin in 2022. NC's base is aging, and it hasn't figured out how to fix that.

### UML: disciplined but geographically boxed in

UML has been remarkably consistent. Its vote share has ranged from 21% to 33% across all elections — a tighter band than any other major party. It peaked in 2017, when its alliance with the Maoists delivered 121 seats (44% of parliament). That was the high-water mark. By 2022, after the alliance collapsed and the attempted merger with the Maoists was ruled unconstitutional, UML fell to 78 seats.

UML's strength is organizational. It has the most disciplined cadre structure in Nepali politics, particularly in the eastern hills and mountain districts. Its weakness is the mirror image of NC's strength: it can't win everywhere. UML is weak in Madhesh and struggles in the western plains. In a coalition era, geographic limitations matter.

### The Maoists: a revolution that peaked in one election

This is maybe the most striking trajectory in the data. The Maoists entered electoral politics in 2008 and won 220 seats — 36.6% of a 601-seat parliament. A former rebel army, voted into power. It was astonishing.

Then came governance. And governance was disappointing. By 2013, the Maoists had crashed to 80 seats. By 2017, they'd dropped to 53 (surviving mainly through their alliance with UML). By 2022, they were down to 32 seats and 11.6% of parliament.

The pattern is clear: 29.3% of the vote in 2008, then 15.4%, then 13.7%, then 12.8%. A party in structural decline, slowly becoming a junior coalition partner rather than a force that shapes governments on its own terms.

### RSP: the new kid everyone's watching

RSP won 20 seats in 2022 — its first election ever. That's the largest debut by a new party in Nepal's democratic history. Its vote share was 13.1%, drawn heavily from urban areas, educated voters, and young people.

The question everyone should be asking: Is RSP the next big thing, or the next Maoists? Because the Maoists' trajectory is a warning. Enter with a bang, govern poorly, fade. Every new party in Nepal has followed some version of this arc. NC and UML have survived for 30-plus years precisely because they have deep organizational roots that outlast any single election cycle. RSP doesn't have that yet.

The 2027 election will be the real test. If RSP can hold its urban base and expand into peri-urban areas, it could become a permanent fixture. If it can't deliver on its technocratic promises, it could follow the Maoists down the same slope.

## The turnout problem is real — but complicated

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Turnout in 2022 was 61%. That's the lowest since Nepal became a democracy. And the trend line isn't great:

The peak was 78.6% in 2013. Then 68.8% in 2017. Then 61% in 2022. A drop of nearly 18 points in less than a decade.

Is this a crisis? Maybe. But the context matters.

The 2008 and 2013 elections were for Constituent Assemblies — they were about writing a new constitution, not just choosing a government. The stakes felt existential. Turnout was high because voters understood they were shaping the country's fundamental rules. The 2017 and 2022 elections were "normal" parliamentary elections under an established constitution. Lower stakes, lower turnout. That's not unique to Nepal. Constitutional referendums and founding elections routinely draw higher participation than regular elections worldwide.

There's also a demographic wrinkle. Nepal has a massive youth population, and young people vote at lower rates everywhere on earth. Add in the fact that millions of Nepalis work abroad — estimates range from 3 to 4 million — and you've got a structural drag on turnout that has nothing to do with democratic disillusionment.

That said, 61% is still concerning. If the trend continues at this rate, Nepal could be looking at 55% or lower by 2027. At some point, low turnout stops being a statistical curiosity and becomes a legitimacy problem.

Here's what makes it tricky: the voters who do show up seem to be making thoughtful choices. They punish bad governance (the Maoists' collapse after 2008, UML's decline after 2017). They reward new ideas (RSP's debut). They split tickets between FPTP and PR ballots. This isn't an electorate that's checked out intellectually. It's an electorate where a growing share has decided that showing up isn't worth the effort.

That distinction matters for how you think about solutions.

## Geography is destiny (mostly)

Pull up a map of Nepal's 2022 election results and you'll see something that looks a lot like America's red-blue divide. Not in terms of ideology, but in terms of geographic sorting.

NC dominates the Kathmandu Valley and western hills. UML owns the eastern hills and mountain districts. The Maoists hold on in their old conflict heartlands — Rolpa, Rukum, Bardiya. RSP is an urban phenomenon: Kathmandu, Chitwan, Pokhara. And Madhesh has its own set of regional parties — JSPN, Loktantrik Samajwadi — that national parties struggle to displace.

This geographic polarization has gotten worse over time. In the 1990s, NC and UML competed everywhere. You could find competitive races between them in almost any district. Now? The battlegrounds have narrowed. Parties increasingly have home turf, and they struggle outside it.

The consequence is that coalition-building isn't just about ideology or policy. It's about assembling a geographically diverse alliance. A party that sweeps the hills but gets wiped out in Madhesh can't govern alone. This is why NC — the one party with genuine cross-regional appeal — keeps ending up in government even when it doesn't win the most seats.

## Women in parliament: a glass ceiling made of FPTP

Here's a number that looks great on paper: roughly 33% of Nepal's parliament is female. That's better than the United States, better than the UK, better than most of South Asia.

But dig into how those women get there, and the picture gets complicated.

| Election | Female Candidates | Female MPs | % of Seats |
|----------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| 1991 | 68 | 6 | 2.9% |
| 1999 | 132 | 12 | 5.9% |
| 2008 | 1,842 | 197 | 32.8% |
| 2013 | 2,180 | 172 | 28.6% |
| 2017 | ~1,000 | 90 | 32.7% |
| 2022 | ~1,200 | 88 | 32.0% |

The jump from 2.9% in 1991 to 32.8% in 2008 is dramatic. But it was almost entirely driven by the constitutional requirement (since 2008) that at least one-third of parliament be women, enforced through reserved positions on PR lists. In FPTP races — where candidates win by getting the most votes in a district — women win only about 4% of seats. Four percent. The quota gets women into parliament, but the direct election pathway remains almost entirely closed to them.

That's not nothing. Having 33% women in parliament changes the kinds of issues that get debated, the kinds of bills that get introduced. But it's a structural ceiling, not organic progress. And until parties start nominating women in winnable FPTP districts — not just slotting them into PR lists to meet a quota — the 33% number will stay flat.

## What voters actually care about (hint: not ideology)

One of the most underappreciated findings in Nepal's electoral data is how pragmatic voters are. The conventional narrative treats Nepal's politics as ideological: communists versus democrats, left versus center. The data says otherwise.

Consider: UML (communist) and NC (democratic socialist) have governed together in coalition multiple times. Madhesi parties have allied with both the left and the center. RSP, which brands itself as technocratic and post-ideological, draws voters from every party's base. In 2022, survey data showed that voters' top concerns were corruption, employment, and service delivery — not ideology, not identity, not geopolitics.

And voters punish failure regardless of party label. The Maoists won 220 seats in 2008 on a wave of revolutionary hope. They governed poorly, and voters cut them down to 80 seats in 2013. That's a 64% seat loss in one election cycle. UML won 121 seats in 2017 on promises of stability and development. When the promised results didn't materialize, voters dropped them to 78 seats in 2022. A 36% decline.

This is actually a sign of democratic health. Voters aren't tribal. They're not locked into party loyalty regardless of performance. They're watching, evaluating, and switching. The volatility that looks like instability from the outside is actually accountability in action.

The caveat: this pragmatism makes the party system unpredictable. If voters are willing to abandon parties quickly, then every election becomes a potential earthquake. That's exciting for democracy. It's terrifying for governance.

## The electoral system itself shapes everything

I can't overstate how much the shift from pure FPTP to a mixed system changed Nepal's politics. It's not just a technical detail. It's the single biggest structural factor driving every trend I've described.

Under FPTP (1991–1999), Nepal had a two-party system. The ENP was 2.3–2.7. Small parties were shut out. NC could win 54% of seats with 38% of the vote. Manufactured majorities meant stable governments but poor representation.

Under the mixed system (2008–2022), the ENP jumped to 3.1–4.8. Small parties won seats through the PR tier. No party could manufacture a majority. Representation improved, but governability suffered.

Here's how the math works. Nepal uses the Sainte-Laguë method for allocating PR seats — a formula that divides each party's total votes by successive odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7...) and awards seats to the highest quotients. It's slightly more favorable to smaller parties than the D'Hondt method used in many European countries. Combined with the FPTP seats (which still favor large parties), you get a system where big parties win a disproportionate share of FPTP seats but then see that advantage diluted by PR seats going to smaller competitors.

The result: the largest party typically ends up with 30–44% of seats. Never a majority. Always a coalition.

Is this a problem? Depends on what you value. If you want decisive governance, yes — Nepal's coalitions are fragile, frequently reshuffled, and often paralyzed by internal negotiations. If you want inclusive representation, no — more voices in parliament means more interests at the table.

Nepal is living the classic trade-off between proportionality and governability. And there's no free lunch. You can't have both.

## The six lessons from 30 years of data

So what does three decades of elections actually teach us? Let me boil it down.

**One: Electoral systems shape party systems.** This sounds obvious, but it's the most important finding. FPTP gave Nepal two parties. Mixed-member proportional gave it five. If Nepal ever changes its electoral system again — and there's periodic talk of it — the party system will change with it.

**Two: New parties rise fast and fall faster.** The Maoists went from 220 seats to 32 in fourteen years. RSP's 20-seat debut in 2022 was historic, but history suggests the hard part isn't breaking through — it's sustaining. Only NC and UML have survived more than three decades. Organizational depth matters more than electoral excitement.

**Three: Coalitions aren't going away.** Four consecutive elections without a single-party majority. The math of the mixed system makes it nearly impossible for one party to cross 50%. Anyone who promises "stable single-party government" is either planning to change the electoral system or selling you something.

**Four: Voters are pragmatic punishers.** They gave the Maoists a chance and took it away. They gave UML a supermajority-level alliance and took that away too. Nepal's electorate isn't ideologically rigid — it's performance-oriented. That's healthy, even if it makes politics volatile.

**Five: Geography is increasingly deterministic.** Parties have home turfs. NC in the west and Kathmandu, UML in the east, Maoists in former conflict zones, RSP in cities, regional parties in Madhesh. This sorting means elections are won and lost in a shrinking number of competitive districts.

**Six: Inclusion has improved, but it's partly artificial.** Women make up 33% of parliament — a huge leap from 3% in 1991. But almost all of that gain comes through PR quotas, not FPTP victories. The structural barrier to women winning direct elections remains largely intact.

## What we don't know (and should be honest about)

I've been making confident-sounding claims for 3,000 words. Let me pump the brakes.

We don't know whether RSP will consolidate or collapse. The data gives us a pattern — new parties fade — but patterns aren't destiny. RSP could be different. We genuinely don't know.

We don't know whether turnout will keep falling. The 2013-to-2022 decline is steep, but three data points isn't a trend line you can extrapolate with confidence. Turnout could stabilize. It could bounce back if the 2027 election feels high-stakes. Or it could keep dropping. Anyone who tells you they know which one is bluffing.

We don't know how federalism will reshape politics over the next decade. The 2015 constitution created seven provinces, and provincial politics are still finding their footing. Provincial elections could eventually create new party dynamics that feed back into national politics in ways we can't predict yet.

And we don't know what happens if NC and UML — the two parties that have anchored Nepal's democracy for 30 years — both continue to lose vote share. Their combined share was about 53% in 2022, down from 65%+ in the 1990s. If that keeps eroding, Nepal could enter a period where no party or even two-party coalition has a natural majority. That would be genuinely new territory.

## The bottom line

Here's what 30 years of data tells us with reasonable confidence: Nepal's democracy is consolidating. Elections happen on schedule. Power transfers peacefully. The range of voices in parliament has expanded enormously. Voters hold parties accountable. These are not small things. Plenty of countries with longer democratic histories can't say all of that.

The challenges are real. Turnout is declining. Coalitions are unstable. Youth voters are drifting away from the established parties — and maybe from voting altogether. Geographic polarization is making national consensus harder to build.

But here's the thing about messy democracies: they're still democracies. Nepal's political system looks chaotic from the outside. Parties split and merge. Prime ministers come and go. Coalition agreements collapse and reform. It's tempting to see all of that as failure.

The data says otherwise. It says Nepal is doing what young democracies do — experimenting, adjusting, sometimes stumbling, but always within the rules. Eight elections in 30 years. Every one of them accepted by the losers. Every transfer of power peaceful.

That's not failure. That's a democracy growing up. It just doesn't look pretty while it happens.
