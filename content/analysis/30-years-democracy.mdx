# Nepal's Democracy Isn't Failing. It's Just Awkward.

<Callout type="info" title="KEY FINDINGS">
  • Nepal's party system has fragmented from 2 to 5 parties since 1991 • Women now hold 33% of
  parliament seats (up from 3% in 1991) • Voter turnout dropped from 78.6% to 61% over a decade •
  Every election since 2008 has produced a coalition government
</Callout>

Thirty years. Eight elections. One civil war. One royal massacre. The abolition of a 240-year-old monarchy. Through all of it, Nepalis kept voting.

<PullQuote>Nepal's democracy isn't failing. It's just awkward.</PullQuote>

The conventional narrative — that Nepal is chronically unstable — is wrong. A deep dive into three decades of electoral data reveals something more hopeful: Nepal's democracy is maturing. It just looks really messy while it does it.

The data tells a story of transformation: from a rigid two-party system to genuine multiparty competition, from manufactured majorities to coalition governments. The transition has been bumpy, but the fundamentals are solid. Elections happen on schedule. Power transfers peacefully. More voices get heard.

Here's what the numbers actually say about Nepal's 30-year democratic experiment.

## Nepal's Electoral Evolution

Nepal's elections haven't happened in a vacuum. Each of the eight national votes since 1991 occurred under dramatically different political contexts — and electoral systems.

**1991-1999: FPTP Era → Two parties dominate**

↓

**2008-2013: Post-Conflict → Mixed system, Maoists enter**

↓

**2017-2022: Federal Era → 165 FPTP + 110 PR seats**

| Election | Year | System    | Seats | Turnout |
| -------- | ---- | --------- | ----- | ------- |
| House 1  | 1991 | FPTP only | 205   | 65.2%   |
| House 2  | 1994 | FPTP only | 205   | 62.8%   |
| House 3  | 1999 | FPTP only | 205   | 65.8%   |
| CA 1     | 2008 | Mixed     | 601   | 78.3%   |
| CA 2     | 2013 | Mixed     | 601   | 78.6%   |
| House 5  | 2017 | Mixed     | 275   | 68.8%   |
| House 6  | 2022 | Mixed     | 275   | 61.0%   |

The big shifts are structural. First came pure first-past-the-post — a system that manufactured majorities. Then came mixed representation after the civil war, bringing Maoists into parliament. Finally came federalism under the 2015 constitution, shrinking parliament to 275 seats.

The peak turnout? 78.6% in 2013, when Nepalis voted for the second time to write their constitution. The low point? 61% in 2022 — a steep 17.6-point decline that should worry everyone.

## From Two Parties to Five: The Fragmentation Story

<PullQuote>
  In the 1990s, Nepal had a two-party system. Today, it has five. That's not chaos — that's
  representation.
</PullQuote>

The numbers tell the story starkly. Nepal's "Effective Number of Parties" — a standard measure of political competition — has nearly doubled:

| Era   | ENP by Seats | Dominant Parties    |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1990s | 2.3-2.7      | NC, UML only        |
| 2008  | 4.2          | + Maoists entered   |
| 2013  | 3.8          | Stabilizing         |
| 2017  | 3.1          | UML-Maoist alliance |
| 2022  | 4.8          | + RSP explosion     |

<Sidebar title="What is ENP?">
  The "Effective Number of Parties" accounts for both how many parties exist AND their relative
  size. ENP of 2 means a pure two-party system. ENP of 5 means genuine multiparty competition.
</Sidebar>

What changed dramatically? In 1999, only 7 parties won seats. By 2008, 25 parties won seats as Maoists entered the ballot box after a decade of civil war. By 2022, 8 parties held 10+ seats.

Under the old FPTP system, small parties were effectively shut out. A party could win 10% of the vote and zero seats. The mixed system (introduced in 2008) changed that. Now those voters actually get representation.

The cost? No single party has won a majority since 2008. Coalition governments aren't a phase — they're the permanent reality. The largest party's seat share dropped from 54% in 1999 to 32.4% in 2022.

<PullQuote>
  Four consecutive elections. Zero majorities. One clear conclusion: Nepal has entered the coalition
  era for good.

## The Rise and Fall of Nepal's Parties

Nepal's parties don't just compete — they swing wildly. But four have stood out over three decades.

| Party           | 1991      | 2008 (Peak) | 2022     | Trend       |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Nepali Congress | 110 seats | 115 seats   | 89 seats | ↔ Stable    |
| UML             | 69 seats  | 121 seats\* | 78 seats | ↔ Stable    |
| Maoist Centre   | 0         | 220 seats   | 32 seats | ↘ Collapsed |
| RSP             | 0         | 0           | 20 seats | ↗ New       |

\*UML's 2017 peak included alliance with Maoists

### Nepali Congress: The Cockroach

<PullQuote>NC is the only truly national party in Nepal.</PullQuote>

Vote share has bounced between 21-38% across eight elections. NC's secret: geography. It's competitive in Kathmandu, the western hills, and parts of Madhesh. No other party can say that.

The problem? NC is old. Young urban voters preferred RSP by an 18-point margin in 2022. NC's base is aging, and they haven't figured out how to fix it.

### UML: The Eastern Fortress

UML's vote share has been remarkably consistent (21-33% across all elections). Peak performance: 2017 alliance with Maoists won 44% of parliament.

**Strength:** Disciplined cadre structure in eastern hills/mountains

**Weakness:** Weak in Madhesh and western plains

**Reality:** Geographic limitations matter in coalition era

### Maoists: The One-Election Wonder

<PullQuote>220 seats in 2008. 32 seats in 2022. That's an 85% collapse.</PullQuote>

Former rebels entered electoral politics and shocked everyone by winning the 2008 election. Then governance happened — and was disappointing. The trajectory: 29.3% (2008) → 15.4% (2013) → 13.7% (2017) → 12.8% (2022).

Clear pattern: A party in structural decline, becoming a junior coalition partner.

### RSP: The New Wildcard

RSP won 20 seats in 2022 — its first election ever. Largest debut in Nepal's democratic history. Vote share: 13.1%, drawn heavily from urban/educated/young voters.

The question: Is RSP the next big thing, or the next Maoists?

The pattern: Every new party enters with a bang, governs poorly, then fades.

The test: 2027 will show if RSP can sustain beyond electoral excitement.

## Turnout: The Quiet Crisis

<Callout type="info" title="THE STAT">
78.6% → 61.0%

Turnout dropped 17.6 points from 2013 to 2022

</Callout>

The 2022 election saw the lowest turnout since Nepal became a democracy. The trend line isn't encouraging:

- 2013: 78.6% (voting for constitution — existential stakes)
- 2017: 68.8% (first federal election under new constitution)
- 2022: 61.0% (ordinary parliamentary election)

Is this a crisis? Maybe. But context matters.

The 2008 and 2013 elections were about writing a new constitution — stakes felt existential. Regular elections always see lower turnout. That's not unique to Nepal.

But the structural drag is real:

- 3-4 million Nepalis work abroad (harder to vote)
- Youth vote at lower rates everywhere (Nepal has massive youth population)
- If trend continues, 2027 could see turnout below 55%

<PullQuote>
  At some point, low turnout stops being a statistical curiosity and becomes a legitimacy problem.
</PullQuote>

The twist: Voters who show up make smart choices. They punish bad governance (Maoists collapsed after 2008). They reward new ideas (RSP's 2022 debut). They split tickets strategically. This isn't a checked-out electorate — it's one where a growing share decided showing up isn't worth the effort.

## What Actually Drives Voting

### Geography Is Destiny (Mostly)

Nepal's electoral map looks like America's red-blue divide — but regional, not ideological.

**PARTY HOME TURFS:**

- **Nepali Congress:** Kathmandu Valley, western hills
- **UML:** Eastern hills, mountain districts
- **Maoists:** Former conflict zones (Rolpa, Rukum)
- **RSP:** Urban centers (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Chitwan)
- **Madhesh parties:** Plains (Province 2)

The consequence: Coalitions require geographic diversity. A party that sweeps the hills but gets wiped out in Madhesh can't govern alone. NC keeps ending up in government because it's the only party competitive across regions.

### Voters Are Pragmatic, Not Ideological

<PullQuote>Nepali voters aren't tribal. They're performance-oriented.</PullQuote>

The conventional narrative treats Nepal's politics as ideological: communists vs democrats, left vs center. The data says otherwise.

**Evidence of pragmatism:**

- UML (communist) and NC (democratic socialist) have governed together multiple times
- Madhesi parties have allied with both left and center
- Survey data: voters' top concerns are corruption, employment, service delivery — not ideology

Voters punish failure regardless of party label:

- Maoists: 220 seats (2008) → 80 seats (2013) = 64% loss
- UML: 121 seats (2017) → 78 seats (2022) = 36% decline

This isn't instability — it's accountability in action.

## Women in Parliament: The Quota Ceiling

<Callout type="success" title="THE LEAP">
  2.9% (1991) → 32.8% (2008) → 32.0% (2022)
</Callout>

Nepal's parliament is now 33% female. That's better than the US, UK, and most of South Asia.

But here's the catch: almost all of that progress comes from **constitutional quotas**, not organic change.

| Election | Female Candidates | Female MPs | % of Seats |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1991     | 68                | 6          | 2.9%       |
| 1999     | 132               | 12         | 5.9%       |
| 2008     | 1,842             | 197        | 32.8%      |
| 2022     | ~1,200            | 88         | 32.0%      |

The FPTP problem: In direct elections (where candidates win by getting the most votes), women win only 4% of seats. Four percent.

<PullQuote>
  The quota gets women into parliament, but the direct election pathway remains almost entirely
  closed.
</PullQuote>

Until parties start nominating women in winnable districts — not just slotting them into PR lists to meet quotas — the 33% number will stay flat.

## Three Lessons from 30 Years

<PullQuote>Eight elections. Every one accepted. Every transfer of power peaceful.</PullQuote>

**1. Electoral systems shape party systems**

FPTP gave Nepal two parties. Mixed-member proportional gave it five. Change the system, and the party system changes with it.

**2. Coalitions are here to stay**

Four consecutive elections without a single-party majority. The math makes 50% nearly impossible. Anyone promising "stable single-party government" is selling you something.

**3. Voters punish, then reward, then punish again**

Maoists won 220 seats in 2008, crashed to 32 by 2022. UML got 121 seats in 2017, fell to 78 in 2022. This isn't instability — it's democratic accountability.

**The bottom line:** Nepal's democracy is consolidating. Elections happen on schedule. Power transfers peacefully. The range of voices has expanded. Parties are held accountable.

It's messy. It's frustrating. But it's working.

## The Unknowns

We don't know everything. Here's what 30 years of data can't tell us:

<Sidebar title="What We Don't Know">
  • Will RSP consolidate or collapse? (Pattern says: collapse) • Will turnout keep falling? (Could
  stabilize, could crash) • How will federalism reshape politics over the next decade? • What if NC
  and UML (democracy's anchors) both continue losing ground?
</Sidebar>

Their combined vote share was 53% in 2022, down from 65%+ in the 1990s. If that keeps eroding, Nepal enters genuinely new territory — where no party or even two-party coalition has a natural majority.

---

## The Bottom Line

Nepal's democracy is 35 years old. It survived civil war, royal massacre, and monarchy abolition. It produced messy, frustrating, sometimes inspiring outcomes.

<PullQuote>
  The data says Nepal is doing what young democracies do — experimenting, adjusting, sometimes
  stumbling, but always within the rules.
</PullQuote>

Eight elections. Every one accepted by the losers. Every transfer of power peaceful.

That's not failure. That's a democracy growing up. It just doesn't look pretty while it happens.
