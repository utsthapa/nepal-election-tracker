# FiveThirtyEight Style Guide for Nepal Votes

## Core Mission

Use data and evidence to advance public knowledge — adding certainty where we can and uncertainty where we must.

## Article Structure

### Opening (The Hook)

- Start with a concrete, timely hook (news event, recent data release, or counterintuitive finding)
- Immediately establish the thesis/hypothesis in 1-3 clear sentences
- Avoid flowery introductions; get to the point quickly
- Example: "Nepal's democracy isn't failing. It's maturing in ways that look messy but represent genuine progress."

### Development (The Evidence)

- Build arguments through evidence first, interpretation second
- Present data points as "clues" that accumulate toward a conclusion
- Address counterexamples and caveats explicitly rather than ignoring them
- Use subheadings every 300-400 words to break up text
- Embed statistics within narrative flow; avoid data dumps

### Conclusion (The Takeaway)

- Summarize what we know with appropriate confidence levels
- Explicitly state what remains uncertain
- Avoid definitive pronouncements when data is ambiguous
- End with a forward-looking insight or question

## Tone & Voice

- **Conversational but rigorous** — accessible to general readers without dumbing down
- **Humble** — willing to say "we don't know" or "the data is unclear"
- **Personality-forward** — writers bring their whole selves; first-person is acceptable
- **Skeptical of narrative** — challenge conventional wisdom and media groupthink
- **Numerate** — comfortable discussing probabilities, margins of error, and uncertainty

## Data Integration Guidelines

### Expressing Uncertainty

- Use precise language: "70% chance" not "likely"
- Distinguish between correlation and causation carefully
- Show your work — explain how conclusions were reached
- Example: "This correlation doesn't prove causation, but it suggests..."

### Statistical Presentation

- Lead with the story, not the methodology
- Express percentages as "X in 100" for accessibility when helpful
- Use confidence intervals when discussing estimates
- Avoid false precision (don't say 47.3% when 47% is sufficient)

### Narrative Data Flow

**Bad:** "The election had 65% turnout. The NC won 110 seats. The UML won 69 seats."

**Good:** "When the votes were counted, Nepalis had delivered a clear verdict: 65% turnout signaled engaged citizenship, and the resulting parliament gave NC a 53% majority — a disproportionate reward for 38% of the vote that would shape the next five years."

## Headline & Subheading Style

### Headlines

- Direct, declarative statements
- Often pose a question or make a counterintuitive claim
- Examples:
  - "Nepal's Democracy Is Maturing, Not Failing"
  - "Why 61% Turnout Isn't As Bad As It Looks"
  - "The RSP Surge Has Rewritten Nepal's Political Math"

### Subheadings

- Explain the thesis more fully
- Use sentence case (not title case)
- Advance the narrative: each section builds on the last
- Examples:
  - "What 30 years of data reveals about party system evolution"
  - "The geography of voting: mountains vs. plains"
  - "Why youth voters are checking out"

## Writing Techniques

### The "Yes, But" Structure

Acknowledge complexity:

- "Coalitions are unstable, yes — but they also prevent any single party from accumulating too much power."
- "Turnout is declining, but the voters who do show up are more informed than ever."

### The Counterintuitive Finding

Lead with surprises:

- "Here's something that defies conventional wisdom..."
- "The data tells a different story than the headlines..."

### The Specific Example

Ground abstractions in specifics:

- Instead of "urban areas have lower turnout"
- Write "In Kathmandu-1, turnout hit 48% — among the lowest in the nation, while remote Humla reached 76%"

### Temporal Anchoring

Connect to current moment:

- "As Nepal prepares for the 2027 election..."
- "Three decades after the first democratic election..."
- "In the wake of the 2022 hung parliament..."

## Nepal-Specific Context

### Key Themes to Emphasize

1. **Federalism transformation** — how 2015 changed everything
2. **Coalition politics** — from exception to norm
3. **Geographic divides** — hills, mountains, plains (Madhesh)
4. **Generational shifts** — youth disengagement vs. new party emergence
5. **Institutional maturation** — peaceful transfers, constitutional stability

### Terms to Use (Correctly)

- "Constituent Assembly" (2008, 2013) vs "House of Representatives" (1991-1999, 2017+)
- "FPTP" (First-Past-The-Post) vs "PR" (Proportional Representation)
- "Madhesh" (preferred) vs "Terai" (acceptable but dated)
- "UML" (not "CPN-UML" after 2017 split)
- "Maoist Centre" (post-2015)

### Context to Provide

- Always explain the Sainte-Laguë method when discussing PR
- Clarify that 2015 Constitution created federal structure
- Note that 2008 was first post-conflict election
- Explain why 2022 RSP emergence matters

## What to Avoid

### Clichés

- "The largest democracy in South Asia"
- "The Himalayan nation"
- "The birthplace of Buddha" (unless relevant)
- "Strategic location between India and China" (unless geopolitical focus)

### Vague Language

- "Significant" (use specific numbers)
- "Many" (quantify)
- "Some observers say" (attribute specifically or omit)
- "It remains to be seen" (say what we know now)

### False Dichotomies

- "Democracy vs stability" (they're interrelated)
- "Traditional vs modern" (oversimplified)
- "Urban vs rural" (acknowledge peri-urban complexity)

## Article Length Targets

- **Comprehensive analysis**: 400-500 lines (~3,000-4,000 words)
- **Standard article**: 300-400 lines (~2,000-3,000 words)
- **Quick analysis**: 200-300 lines (~1,500-2,000 words)

Target for rewrites: **400-500 lines** (comprehensive, data-rich)

## Formatting Conventions

### Tables

- Use for systematic comparisons
- Include source notes
- Keep formatting clean (Markdown tables)

### Lists

- Use sparingly for key takeaways
- Prefer narrative flow for most content

### Blockquotes/Callouts

- Use for key statistics or surprising findings
- Format as: **Key stat**: X% of Y did Z

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Opening hook grabs attention
- [ ] Thesis is clear within first 3 paragraphs
- [ ] Data is woven into narrative (not dumped)
- [ ] Uncertainty is expressed appropriately
- [ ] Counterarguments are addressed
- [ ] Conclusion summarizes what we know + don't know
- [ ] Subheadings advance the narrative
- [ ] Length is 400-500 lines
- [ ] Tone is conversational but rigorous
- [ ] All statistics are accurate and sourced

## Example Opening (Target Style)

**Original:**
"Nepal's democratic journey spans three decades, seven parliamentary elections, two constituent assemblies, a decade-long civil war, a royal massacre, the abolition of monarchy, and fundamental constitutional transformation."

**538 Style:**
"Thirty years ago, Nepal held its first free election after 30 years of autocratic rule. Since then, the country has survived a civil war, a royal massacre, and the abolition of its monarchy. Through it all, one thing remained constant: Nepalis kept voting. What does three decades of electoral data reveal about how democracy has — and hasn't — taken root?"

### How to Write Naturally

**1. Use Contractions**

- "It's" not "It is"
- "Don't" not "Do not"
- "Can't" not "Cannot"
- "We're" not "We are"

**2. Vary Sentence Length Dramatically**

```
Short punchy sentence.
Followed by a longer, more meandering sentence that builds on the idea with additional context and maybe a parenthetical thought.
Then another short one.
```

**3. Start Sentences With Conjunctions**

- "But the data tells a different story."
- "And that's where it gets interesting."
- "So what happened next?"

**4. Use Fragments (Sparingly)**

- "The result? A hung parliament."
- "The reason? Simple."
- "The consequence? Coalition politics."

**5. Write Like You Talk**

- "Here's the thing" instead of "It's worth noting"
- "Turns out" instead of "Interestingly"
- "Actually" instead of "In reality"
- "Look" instead of "Consider"

**6. Avoid Perfect Parallelism**

```
Bad:  "The election was free, fair, and transparent."
Good: "The election was free and fair — transparent enough that even losers conceded."
```

**7. Use Specific, Concrete Language**

```
Bad:  "Many voters participated in the democratic process."
Good: "7.4 million Nepalis stood in line, many for hours, to cast their ballots."
```

**8. Show Personality**

- Occasional mild skepticism: "Supposedly..."
- Direct address: "Think about it..."
- Rhetorical questions: "What does that tell us?"
- Mild surprise: "Oddly enough..."

### The "Smell Test"

Before finalizing, read aloud. If it sounds:

- Like a textbook → Rewrite
- Like a press release → Rewrite
- Like you wouldn't say it to a friend at a bar → Rewrite
- Like you're trying to sound smart → Rewrite

### Examples: AI vs Human

**AI Version:**
"Moreover, the intricate tapestry of Nepal's electoral landscape underscores the multifaceted nature of democratic consolidation, highlighting the complex interplay between institutional frameworks and voter behavior."

**Human Version:**
"Nepal's elections look messy. That's not a bug — it's a feature. The chaos reflects genuine competition, which means democracy is working, however awkwardly."

**AI Version:**
"It is worth noting that turnout declined significantly, underscoring the challenges facing democratic participation."

**Human Version:**
"Turnout dropped. That's not great. But here's the thing: the people who did vote? They were engaged. They knew the issues. Quality over quantity, maybe."

## Final Note

The goal is not to sound like FiveThirtyEight copies — it's to bring the same rigorous, data-driven, intellectually honest approach to Nepali politics. Write for readers who care about Nepal but may not be experts. Respect their intelligence. Show your work. And never pretend to know more than the data allows.

**Most importantly: Write like a human who cares about this stuff, not an algorithm trying to sound authoritative.**
